## PURPOSE
Presentation of the Minimum Prototyping Platform (MPP) project line dedicated to build and deliver CYBNITY demonstrator versions, used to define and deliver versions of an official and maintained technologies stack usable by CYBNITY Foundation project(s).
The implementation documentation includes many types of support deliverables produced during the software development life cycle.
You can find documentations relative to demonstrators realization and/or stack maintenance (catalog of technologies) like:
- MPP technology opportunities identification;
- Technologies analysis and MPP delivery;
- Proof Of Concept (POC) execution and conclusions;
- Technical tests of selected technology sets for validation of required capabilities and benefits justifying to become a new MPP official version;
- Support to software build process and packaging;
- Technologies set configuration and usage procedure(s).

This technical documentations are supporting the functional, architectural and/or organizational documentations available on [CYBNITY Universe](https://cybnity.notion.site/CYBNITY-Universe-c707ba2ebc3047c6ad533f18b2e0f9db) public web site about concept, requirements, business/technology/systems architectures...

# LONG TERM GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS
Presents the standard goals that should be reached and benefits that are targeted to be collected from the official technology stack by CYBNITY projects.

A set of common requirements is defined as frame of principles need to be maintained by any version of the CYBNITY official technology stack.

It's possible that new goals entry enhance the common goals, regarding specific technology and/or implementation layers during a new version development of the standards catalog.
