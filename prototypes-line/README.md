## PURPOSE
Presentation of the technology stack project line dedicated to build and deliver CYBNITY prototype versions.

Based on the accepted innovations and needs, on basic features identified by the demonstrators and/or on the technologies stack versions to validate (as Proof-Of-Concept supporting the required target architecture models), this development line is dedicated to prototyping activities with Minimum Viable Features (MVF) platform delivery for technology scope.

The developed prototypes are categorized according to:
| PROTOTYPE CATEGORY | STANDARD OBJECTIVES | TYPES OF PROTOTYPE VERSION | USAGE TYPE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TECHSTACK` |- Tests of technologies compatibility<br>- Check of requirements and technology complexity|Buildable and executable software regarding a limited scope (e.g HelloWorld sample) without functional development|Contribution to the acceptance phase (e.g step 2) of a Foundation Techstack's new technology set version|

### Sources Structure
Prototypes source codes allow the build and delivery of specification and/or demonstration artifacts.
Prototypes are built via Maven tool using a [standard Maven project structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).
