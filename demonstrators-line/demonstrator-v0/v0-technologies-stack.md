## PURPOSE
This section develop, document and elaborate detailed designs progressively using agreed-on and rapid agile development techniques, addressing all components (business processes and related automated and manual controls, supporting IT applications, infrastructure services and technology products, and partners/suppliers). Ensure that the detailed design includes internal and external SLAs and OLAs.

This section presents the design specifications about the solutions and technology approved for build.

# LONG TERM GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS
Presents the standard goals that should be reached and benefits that are targeted to be collected from the official technology stack by CYBNITY projects.
A set of common requirements is defined as frame of principles need to be maintained by any version of the CYBNITY official technology stack.
It's possible that new goals entry enhance the common goals, regarding specific technology and/or implementation layers during a new version development of the standards catalog.
