## PURPOSE
This section develop, document and elaborate detailed designs progressively using agreed-on and rapid agile development techniques, addressing all components (business processes and related automated and manual controls, supporting IT applications, infrastructure services and technology products, and partners/suppliers). Ensure that the detailed design includes internal and external SLAs and OLAs.

This section presents the design specifications about the solutions and technology approved for build.

# GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS
Respond to the set of common requirements defined as frame of principles need to be maintained by any version of the CYBNITY official technology stack.

### Objectives
Definition of a minimal set of components allowing to:

-
