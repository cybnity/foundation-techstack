## PURPOSE
Welcome on the CYBNITY Minimum Prototyping Platform (MPP) open source project which target to deliver a standard kit of technologies platform efficient, flexible and reusable by CYBNITY Foundation project as technologies stack catalog.

### Our Mission
We develop demonstrators as MPP validating the relevant usage of technologies to help the CYBNITY Foundation development teams designing and implementing open source software.
### How It Works?
The CYBNITY MPP makes it possible via development of demonstrators and test campaigns through demo to real users (e.g demo of technology capabilities).
The documentation includes many types of support deliverables produced during the software development life cycle.
You can find documentations relative to demonstrators realization and/or stack maintenance (catalog of technologies) like:
- MPP technology opportunities identification;
- Technologies analysis and MPP delivery;
- Proof Of Concept (POC) execution and conclusions;
- Technical tests of selected technology sets for validation of required capabilities and benefits justifying to become a new MPP official version;
- Support to software build process and packaging;
- Technologies set configuration and usage procedure(s).

This technical documentations are supporting the functional, architectural and/or organizational documentations available on [CYBNITY Universe](https://cybnity.notion.site/CYBNITY-Universe-c707ba2ebc3047c6ad533f18b2e0f9db) public web site about concept, requirements, business/technology/systems architectures...

### Our Methods
This is a presentation of the Minimum Prototyping Platform (MPP) project line dedicated to build and deliver CYBNITY demonstrator versions, used to define and deliver versions of an official and maintained technologies stack usable by CYBNITY Foundation project(s).

The MPP and demonstrators delivery is a contributor sub-process of the global CYBNITY Defense Platform's delivery process.

# DELIVERABLES
The documentations produced during a demonstrator delivery are managed and store per version in sub-directory named "demonstrators-line".

## CURRENT MPP OFFICIAL VERSION
- Version: V0
- [Official Technologies Stack](demonstrators-line/demonstrator-v0/v0-technologies-stack.md) for demonstrator developers, testers and managers.

## FUTURE MPPs & DEMONSTRATORS
See the [future stack releases plan](docs/releases-plan.md).

## MPP PREVIOUS VERSIONS
List of previous technologies set versions that are deprecated and out of the maintenance life cycle.

| Version | Usage Goal | Description | Delivery |
