## PURPOSE
Welcome on the CYBNITY Minimum Prototyping Platform (MPP) open source project which target to deliver a standard kit of technologies platform efficient, flexible and reusable by CYBNITY Foundation project as technologies stack catalog.
### Our Mission
We develop demonstrators as MPP validating the relevant usage of technologies to help the CYBNITY Foundation development teams designing and implementing open source software.
### How It Works?
The CYBNITY MPP makes it possible via development of demonstrators and test campaigns through demo to real users (e.g demo of technology capabilities).
### Our Methods
The MPP and demonstrators delivery is a contributor sub-process of the global CYBNITY Defense Platform's delivery process.

# THE DEMONSTRATORS
The documentations produced during a demonstrator delivery are managed and store per version in sub-directory named "demonstrators-line".

## SUPPORT & DOCS
- [Technical documentations](docs/README.md) for demonstrator developers, testers and managers.
